Requirements:
=============
The first thing we’d like you to do after you read the project description is to estimate how long it will take you to complete, and then to make a promise to your interviewer that you will deliver it by a particular date.
Please bear in mind that you will need to show a finished project at this interview, however you can contact Ivan via email at any time before the due date to clarify any aspect of it.
Just as a reminder, the requirements for the test project are:
Write a simple time management system
User must be able to create an account and log in
User can add (and edit and delete) a row what he has worked on, what date, for how long
User can add a setting „Preferred working hours per day“
If on a certain date a user has worked under the PreferredWorkingHourPerDay, these rows are red, otherwise green.
Implement at least two roles with different permission levels (ie: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on his owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, an admin would be able to CRUD on all records and users, etc.)
Filter entries by date from-to
Export the filtered times to a sheet in HTML:
Date: 21.5
Total time: 9h

REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Parse.com, Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile app, disregard this)
Bonus: unit tests!
You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
NOTE: Please keep in mind that this is the project that will be used to evaluate your skills. The project will be evaluated as if you are delivering it to a customer. We expect you to make sure that the app is fully functional and doesn’t have any obvious missing pieces. The deadline for the project is 2 weeks from today.
